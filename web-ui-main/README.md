Problem Statement â€“ Web Navigator AI Agent

Title:
BrowserUse

Description:
Finding information on the web is often repetitive and time-consuming. Users need to perform searches, open multiple websites, extract information, or complete tasks like form filling manually.

Problem:
Manual web navigation for tasks like research, data collection, or monitoring websites takes significant time and effort, especially for repetitive or multi-step processes.

Proposed Solution:
Develop a Web Navigator AI Agent that can autonomously perform web tasks based on natural language instructions. The agent can:

Search for information on the web

Open multiple websites

Extract or summarize relevant content

Simulate user interactions like clicking links or filling forms

Goal:
Create a minimal prototype where a user inputs a task (in plain English), and the AI agent demonstrates step-by-step autonomous navigation or simulation of web tasks.

Impact:

Saves time for repetitive online tasks

Helps researchers, students, and professionals quickly gather information

Provides a foundation for intelligent autonomous agents that can interact with the web
Frontend

React 19: The user interface is built using React 19, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Next.js 15 (App Router): Next.js 15 is used for server-side rendering and routing, enhancing the performance and scalability of the application.

TypeScript 2: TypeScript 2 provides static typing, improving code quality and maintainability.

Tailwind CSS v4: Tailwind CSS v4 is employed for utility-first CSS styling, allowing for rapid and responsive design.

Radix UI Primitives: Radix UI Primitives offer low-level UI components that are accessible and customizable.

Backend

Python: The backend is developed in Python, leveraging its simplicity and readability.

Playwright: Playwright is used for browser automation, enabling the AI agent to interact with web pages programmatically.

uvicorn: uvicorn serves as the ASGI server for running the application, providing high-performance asynchronous capabilities.

AI Integration

OpenAI GPT-3.5: The application integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to process natural language instructions and generate responses.

LangChain: LangChain is utilized to manage and chain together multiple language model calls, facilitating complex workflows.
